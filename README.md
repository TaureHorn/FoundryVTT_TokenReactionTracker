# Token Reaction Tracker
### Track token combat reaction usage on the Token HUD

![TOKEN HUD](https://github.com/TaureHorn/FoundryVTT_TokenReactionTracker/raw/main/screenshot.jpg)
Designed with DnD5e in mind where a creature gets one reaction per round of combat. Sometimes it is difficult to remeber and keep track of which creatures have used their reactions.

## Todo
Auto clear tokens reaction state in combat at the start of the combatants turn
