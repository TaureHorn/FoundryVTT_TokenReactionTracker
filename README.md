# Token Reaction Tracker
### Track token combat reaction usage on the Token HUD
![TOKEN HUD](https://github.com/TaureHorn/FoundryVTT_TokenReactionTracker/raw/main/screenshot.png)

Designed with DnD5e in mind where a creature gets one reaction per round of combat. Sometimes it is difficult to remember and keep track of which creatures have used their reactions. This module will allow you to manually track which tokens have used their reactions.

Additionally when in combat, tokens that have used their reaction will have refreshed at the start of their turn. This will only apply to the token linked to the combat encounter and not to all tokens if you run things by using multiple creatures on the same initiative.

While this is designed with DnD5e in mind, it does not at present integrate with the character sheets. This also means this module is system agnostic if you can find the need in another system for this mechanic.

## Settings
### GM only
- Enable in combat only: Only shows the reaction tracker button on the token HUD when in combat
- Disable auto refresh: Disables the effect that auto refreshes a tokens reaction on the HUD marker when they start their turn in combat
### GM & Players
- Disable scrolling text: Disables token scrolling text that displays when a tokens reaction state changes.
